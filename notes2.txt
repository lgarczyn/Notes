mechas
    fat mecha are bad
        look dumb
        no sense of scale
        toyetic
    
    colored mecha can be good, but
        usually end up goldorak
        and in the end, even gurren lagan designs are unmemorable

    designs need to be unque
        long arm/wing from laputa
        head-mecha from gurren lagaan
        mouth abdominal region
        no head is good
    
    clear inspirations are good
